# Divekit

The tool Divekit implements a set of features which are used to automatically provide programming exercises in form of repositories on the platform Gitlab. Optionally exercises can be individualized using the integrated mechanism for individualization. Besides the Divekit there are additional tools which extend the toolchain by building on top of Divekit functionality.
